Following along with *Eloquent Javascript's* [project](https://eloquentjavascript.net/2nd_edition/07_elife.html). Translating into translate ES6 syntax (and finally understanding how arrow functions work with ```this```). Trying to adhere to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.

The script runs the simulation again and again, indefinitely, keeping tally of the number of wins of Plants vs Herbivores. The aim is to automate tests for correlation between win-rate and, e.g., grow-rate of plants, reproduction-cost for herbivores, initial population of herbivores, etc.

## Animation:

## Next Steps:
- [ ] Automate the tweaking of parameters to get most stable ecosystems. (Stretch: use machine learning).
- [ ] Map the populations in real-time to observe predator-prey cycles.
- [ ] Search for correlation between length of runtime and winning species.
