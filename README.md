## Results
Currently we're getting about 1 plant : 2 herbivore win rates (14:28). But now 28: 50. 31 : 55. 45: 86. 50: 91. 57: 98. 64: 109. Now let's clean up the checker function.

With a few more checkers, we have 20: 32, 24: 42, 28: 48, 31: 57.

(Hmm this is the opposite effect than I anticipated:)
(Well I suppose it's possible they both converge toward same amount. Will need to automate this.)
With all catcher, we have 9: 20, 13: 34, 20: 52, 25: 59, 28: 67, 35: 75
